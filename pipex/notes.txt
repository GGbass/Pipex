PIPEX
To create a pipe system for the terminal, you can follow these steps, which are based on the information provided in the sources:

1.- Understand the Basics of Pipes: Pipes in Linux and Unix-like operating systems are used to connect the output of one command to the input of another.
This allows you to chain commands together, where the output of one command becomes the input of the next. This is particularly useful for filtering
and processing data in a streamlined manner 13.

2.- Syntax for Using Pipes: 
The basic syntax for using pipes is command_1 | command_2 | command_3 | ... | command_N. This means the output of command_1 is passed as input to command_2, and so on.
For example, to list all files and directories and then filter them to find a specific file, you could use ls | grep file.txt 3.


3.- Creating a Simple Pipe Example: Suppose you want to list all files in a directory, filter them to find files with "page"
in their name, and then count the number of such files. You could use the 
following command: ls | grep "page" | wc -l. This command uses ls to list files, grep to filter for files with "page", and wc -l to 
count the number of lines in the output, effectively counting the number of files found 1.

4.- Using Named Pipes: Named pipes, also known as FIFOs (First In, First Out), allow data to be stored in a pipe with a name in the filesystem.
This can be useful for inter-process communication. To create a named pipe, use the mkfifo command followed by the name of the pipe.
For example, mkfifo my_pipe. You can then use this named pipe in your commands with redirection operators (< for input and > for output) 1.


5.-Implementing Pipes in a Custom Shell: If you're interested in implementing pipes in a custom shell, you'll need to handle the creation of pipes using the pipe() function,
fork new processes for each command, and manage the redirection of standard input and output between these processes.
This involves copying file descriptors, closing unnecessary ones, and executing commands using execvp().
For example, in child 1, you would close the read end of the pipe, copy the write end to stdout, and execute the first command. In child 2,
you would do the opposite: close the write end, copy the read end to stdin, and execute the second command 2.


6.- Handling Multiple Commands with Pipes: When chaining multiple commands together with pipes,
it's important to manage the flow of data correctly. Each command in the chain should read from the previous command's
output and write to the next command's input. This can be achieved by carefully managing file descriptors and ensuring that
each command is executed in the correct order 2.

Debugging and Testing: When creating a pipe system, it's crucial to test each part of the system individually before integrating them.
This helps in identifying and fixing issues early in the development process. You can also use tools like strace to trace system calls and signals,
which can be helpful for debugging 1.
By following these steps and understanding the principles behind pipes, 
you can create a powerful and flexible system for processing and filtering data in the terminal.
